# EncryptDataLibrary

This is a simple encryption library for Roblox, implemented in Lua. It provides functions to encrypt and decrypt data using a fixed key. The encryption method used is XOR-based with a simple hashing function to generate a key from a string.

## Features

- **Fixed Key Encryption**: The library uses a fixed key for both encryption and decryption.
- **XOR-Based Encryption**: A lightweight XOR encryption method is used, making it suitable for simple use cases within Roblox.

## Installation

To use this library in your Roblox project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `EncryptDataLibrary` script into your Roblox project.
2. Require the `EncryptDataLibrary` in any script where you want to use encryption or decryption.

Also you can clone the repo and use the ROJO plugin to import the scripts to your game easily.
   **The .rbxl file is attached to the repository**

## Usage

### 1. Encrypting Data

To encrypt data, use the `encryptData` function:

```lua
local EncryptDataLibrary = require(path.to.EncryptDataLibrary)

local originalData = "SensitiveData123"
local encryptedData = EncryptDataLibrary:encryptData(originalData)
print("Encrypted Data: " .. encryptedData) 
```

### 2. Decrypting Data

To decrypt data, use the `decryptData function:`

```lua

local decryptedData = EncryptDataLibrary:decryptData(encryptedData)
print("Decrypted Data: " .. decryptedData)
```
# Example
Here is a complete example of `encrypting` and `decrypting` data:

```lua

local EncryptDataLibrary = require(path.to.EncryptDataLibrary)

local originalData = "SensitiveData123"

-- Encrypt the data
local encryptedData = EncryptDataLibrary:encryptData(originalData)
print("Encrypted Data: " .. encryptedData)

-- Decrypt the data
local decryptedData = EncryptDataLibrary:decryptData(encryptedData)
print("Decrypted Data: " .. decryptedData)
```

### Security Considerations
`Fixed Key:` The library uses a hardcoded fixed key (FixedSecretKey123) for encryption and decryption. This key should be kept secret to prevent unauthorized access to your data.
`Obfuscation:` While this library provides basic encryption, it is not suitable for highly sensitive data. For better security, consider more advanced encryption techniques and key management strategies.
